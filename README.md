Animalia Paradoxa
=================

This is not (even close to) an exhaustive list on the topic of data analytics. This is just a list of stuff I've collected that I thought might be useful to others.


This repo contains [the list](http://charlesflynn.github.io/animalia-paradoxa) in several formats:
-   Zotero [RDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework)
-   JSON
-   PDF (bibliography produced by Zotero)
-   Gephi source file
-   plain old CSV


There's also:
-   A sql file that creates the views used by Gephi
-   A sql file that creates the view for exporting
-   A Python script that produces the JSON and CSV formats


Tools I used (and highly recommend):
-   [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org)
-   [Gephi](https://gephi.org)
-   [Sigmajs Exporter](https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/sigmajs-exporter)
-   [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid)
